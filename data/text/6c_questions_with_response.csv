6c,fall_2019,1a,Briefly describe three reasons the insurance industry was singled out for specific solvency legislation in the 1870s.,"Many insurers went bankrupt in 1870’s. Insurance often carries a saving /investing component or function, so it is very important to protect the policyholder. It was recognized that short term price competition is harmful for insurance",,,"

The insurance industry was singled out for specific solvency legislation in the 1870s due to the need for workers compensation insurance, the need for a stable source of affordable insurance coverage, and the fear of insurance companies imposing excessive premium rates that would be a financial burden.","

1. The insurance industry was growing rapidly and becoming increasingly complex, making it difficult to regulate.

2. Insurance companies were taking on more risk and engaging in more speculative practices, leading to concerns about their solvency.

3. There were numerous cases of insurance companies failing and leaving policyholders without protection, leading to a need for better oversight."
6c,fall_2019,1b,Briefly describe a reason guidelines are often favoured over legislation as a form of insurance regulation.,"Changes to legislation must go through the senate, house of commons and the royal approval, while guidelines don’t need to go through these steps","Guidelines are subject to interpretation, so more flexible than legislation",Guidelines are interpreted rules on how things should be done,"

Guidelines are often favoured over legislation as a form of insurance regulation because they provide more flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. They also provide more clarity and specificity than legislation, allowing insurers to better understand their obligations and responsibilities. Guidelines also allow regulators to set more specific rules and regulations that are tailored to the needs of the industry and the consumers. Lastly, they provide a more efficient way to keep up with changes in the industry and to ensure that the regulations remain up-to-date.","

Guidelines are often favoured over legislation as a form of insurance regulation because they can be more flexible and adaptive to changing market conditions. Guidelines are not as rigid as legislation and can be modified more easily to respond to changes in the industry. Additionally, guidelines provide a framework for insurers to follow, but also allow for some flexibility in how they operate. This can help to ensure that insurers are able to respond quickly to changes in the market, while still adhering to industry standards."
6c,fall_2019,1c,Briefly describe four key principles the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) uses in risk assessment of insurance companies.,Be forward looking to allow early intervention. Use sound predictive judgement. Identification of risk: must be able to identify all material risks. Differentiate inherent risks and risk management,Dynamic adjustments. Sound predictive judgement. Differentiate between inherent risk and risk mitigation. Understanding drivers of risks: should understand what the key causes of risks are,,"

OSFI has four key principles for risk assessment of insurance companies: 1) Focus on material risk, 2) Sound predictive judgment, 3) Prudent approaches to managing earthquake risk, and 4) Proportional supervisory review of an insurer's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA).","

1. Risk Management: OSFI requires insurers to have sound risk management practices in place that are appropriate for their size, complexity, and risk profile. Insurers must have systems in place to identify, measure, monitor, and control risks.

2. Capital Adequacy: OSFI requires insurers to maintain capital adequacy levels that are appropriate for their size, complexity, and risk profile. The capital adequacy requirements are based on the risks that the insurer is exposed to and the quality of the insurer’s risk management practices.

3. Governance: OSFI requires insurers to have effective governance practices in place that ensure that risks are managed properly. This includes having a board of directors that is knowledgeable and experienced in the insurance industry, and having processes in place to ensure that the board is informed and can exercise oversight.

4. Risk-Based Supervision: OSFI monitors insurers through a risk-based supervision process. This includes assessing the insurer’s risk management practices, capital adequacy levels, and governance practices, and providing feedback to the insurer on areas for improvement."
