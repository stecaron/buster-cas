Questions and parts of some solutions have been taken from material copyrighted by the Casualty Actuarial
Society. They are reproduced in this study manual with the permission of the CAS solely to aid students studying
for the actuarial exams. Some editing of questions has been done. Students may also request past exams directly
from the society. I am very grateful to the CAS for its cooperation and permission to use this material. It is, of
course, in no way responsible for the structure or accuracy of the manual"
10,Actex CAS 6 Canada Fall 2019 sample .pdf,5,"The material is organised roughly in the same manner as the learning objectives, mirroring the organisation of
past exams. Some sections are not outlined because they are tables or Excel spreadsheets. However, in most
cases either old exam questions or review questions are included to help you learn the material"
11,Actex CAS 6 Canada Fall 2019 sample .pdf,5,"Exam questions are identified by numbers in parentheses at the end of each question. CAS questions have four
numbers separated by hyphens: the year of the exam, the number of the exam, the number of the question, and the
points assigned. For those readings with no or few appropriate exam questions, review questions were created to
aid students, numbered R1, R2, and so on. A few recent exam questions were based on several readings but are
only included after one of the readings"
12,Actex CAS 6 Canada Fall 2019 sample .pdf,5,"An attempt has been made to clean up irrelevant and redundant questions and answers. I have also made a
conscientious effort to eliminate mistakes and incorrect answers; I am certain some remain. I encourage students
who find errors to bring them to my attention. Please check our website for corrections subsequent to publication"

I.     THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN CANADA
       A.      Types of Insurance Carriers
               1.     Individual underwriters
                      a.       Rare in North America
                      b.       Lloyd's of London
                               1)      Similar to a stock exchange except open only to members, not the public
                               2)      Types of members
                                       a)       Underwriting members – members who accept risk on their
                                                own account, acting through private syndicates and underwriting
                                                agents
                                       b)       Nonunderwriting members – members who “enjoy all but
                                                insuring privileges”
                                                i)       Subscribers – nonunderwriting members who “act as
                                                         brokers on behalf of the public and place risks with
                                                         Underwriting Members”
                                                ii)      Associates – nonunderwriting members who perform
                                                         services for members, e.g., lawyers, actuaries
               2.     Joint stock companies – for-profit organizations made up of stockholders but managed
                      by its board of directors and officers
               3.     Mutual insurance carriers – corporate insurers whose voting control rests with
                      policyholders rather than stockholders
               4.     Reciprocal or interinsurance exchanges – organizations “of individuals who have
                      joined together for the exchange of insurance”
                      a.       Do not issue policies
                      b.       Members are individually liable
               5.     Differences in structure not seen as that important as mainly involve corporate law
       B.      The Nature of Competition in the Insurance Industry
               1.     Exemption of insurance from anticombines legislation attributable to danger of
                      uncontrolled price competition producing bankruptcies
               2.     Industry encouraged to charge adequate premiums through the authorization and
                      regulation of rating bureaus
                      a.       Principal bureau is the Insurers Advisory Organization (IAO)
                      b.       Superintendents also appoint statistical agency, usually the Statistical Division of
                               the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC)

                2.      Solvency
                        a.      Nineteenth-century legislation seeks to prevent insurer insolvency following the
                                company failures in the U.S. and U.K"

                                4)      Governmental power of enforcement
                                5)      Creation of rating bureaus and in some provinces administrative boards

                  c.      Reasons for regulation of insurance
                          1)      Loss of public confidence following bankruptcies
                          2)      Short-term price competition seen as not in the public interest
                          3)      Fiduciary nature of insurance as money collected in advance
                  d.      Protection against insolvency remains a major function today
               3. Canadianization
                  a.      1868–77 – foreign companies required to maintain sufficient assets in Canada
                  b.      Such protects policyholders but also prevents expatriation of capital
                  c.      Results in the withdrawal of half of the foreign companies and the expansion of
                          Canadian companies
               4. Government revenue – 1869–70 comprised about 15% of government revenue; share has
                  declined over time
               5. Regulating the contract
                  a.      1876 – ON regulates fire policies
                  b.      Courts disallow federal attempts at policy regulation, leaving it to the provinces
                  c.      Extent of regulation varies with the type of insurance
                          1)      Fire – statutory policy conditions
                          2)      Auto – superintendent must approve forms
                          3)      Other P&C – less regulated
                          4)      Life – laws prohibit certain practices and grant certain rights
                          5)      Other personal lines (e.g., A&S) – legislation combines fire and life
                                  features
                          6)      Group life and credit life – regulated by the industry
               6. Control over insurance intermediaries
                  a.      Traditionally, intermediaries have had some independence from insurers
                  b.      Examples
                          1)      Agent
                          2)      Broker – term applicable to an agent representing more than one company
                          3)      Adjuster
                  c.      Many companies use employees rather than intermediaries
                  d.      Principles for regulating life agents in more than one province
                          1)      Single-company representation
                                  a)       Abandonment of this in most common law provinces
                                  b)       In such cases, agent's actions governed by a contract with the
                                           company, rather than the legislation
                                  c)       But one-company representation still permitted
                          2)      Company sponsorship for a license
                                  a)       Basic training concentrated within a company
                                  b)       But no statutory authorization or the statutory creation of a board
                                           of self-regulation
                                  c)       Some provinces specify prerequisites and some require passage
                                           of a standard exam but waivers possible
                          3)      Superintendents participate in the continuing education of agents
                          4)      Life Underwriters of Canada establishes standards of conduct; violation
                                  brings penalties

                      e.       Regulation of other-than-life agents
                               1)      Self-regulation by statutorily established associations
                               2)      Licensing by the superintendent but training by the company
                               3)      Six provinces adopt an exam but waivers possible
                      f.       Licensing of adjusters varies by province, though most require
                               sponsoring/recommendation by a licensed adjuster
               7.     Direct control over marketing practices
                      a.       In general, insurance exempt from general regulation governing the marketing of
                               goods and services
                      b.       Several provincial insurance acts prohibit specified unfair acts or practices
               8.     Form of insurance regulation
                      a.       Three levels of regulation
                               1)      Legislation
                               2)      Regulations of the Lieutenant Governor in Council
                               3)      Regulations by the superintendent
                                       a)       Reflect consultations with the industry but public involvement
                                                varies
                                       b)       At times the basis of authority is uncertain
                      b.       Recently guidelines preferred over more formal regulation
                               1)      May appear to be a solution while permitting inconsistent activities
                               2)      Seen as more flexible
                               3)      Less open to judicial interpretation as public given no rights
                               4)      Adoption does not require approval of other parts of the government
      B.       The Constitutional Power to Regulate Insurance – Provincial Jurisdiction over Insurance Law
               1.     No mention in the Constitution Act of 1867 but need seen shortly afterwards with U.S"
21,Actex CAS 6 Canada Fall 2019 sample .pdf,9,"                      and U.K. bankruptcies
               2.     Other motives behind federal regulation: promotion of investment and revenue gain
               3.     Provincial focus (e.g., ON) on marketing practices and contractual terms
               4.     Privy Council upholds ON legislation regulating fire policies but finds trade and
                      commerce clause insufficient basis for federal regulatory schemes (1916–32)
               5.     1932 legislation gives the federal government powers related to the solvency (but not
                      contract provisions) of federally registered companies
               6.     Sees conflicts between federal and provincial regulation as not reflecting a sharp division
                      between laissez-faire and interventionist approaches as at times each level had advocated
                      each of the approaches
               7.     No political tension between the two levels in the last 40 years
      C.       The Role of the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators
               1.     Promotes uniformity in provincial regulation
               2.     Comparable functions to the Uniform Law Conference of Canada in areas other than
                      insurance law
               3.     But not limited to the drafting of legislation; also encourages uniform practices
               4.     Much greater public input than in the case of the Privy Council

III.   TYPES OF INSURANCE
       A.      Overview
               1.      Roles of classification in insurance law
                       a.       Provides organizing principles
                       b.       Identifies similarities or differences
                       c.       Suggests solutions for problems
                       d.       Balance generalization and particularization
               2.      Insurance law seen subject to more inconsistencies than other legal areas (e.g., contracts)
                       for the following reasons:
                       a.       Principles of marine law not applicable for newer types
                       b.       Limited legislative reform produces a complex patchwork
               3.      Legal divisions differ from industry's marketing divisions
       B.      Social and Private Insurance
               1.      Differences
                       a.       Social insurance generally has a universal application but not risk selection
                       b.       Social insurance does not have a need to protect the public from gaming
                       c.       Social insurance does not require extensive solvency protection
                       d.       Different supervision of intermediaries in social insurance as are civil servants
               2.      Similarities
                       a.       Rules to protect the insurance fund and prevent double recovery
                       b.       Problems regarding covered events and whether loss is covered by insured event
                       c.       Problems involving efficient claims settlements and loss valuation
       C.      Marine and Nonmarine Insurance
               1.      Many basic notions are common, e.g., insurable interest, subrogation, etc"

24,Actex CAS 6 Canada Fall 2019 sample .pdf,10,"               1.      Question as to whether an insurer has subrogation rights to a third-party payment of
                       medical expenses when it pays the same expenses under an insurance contract
               2.      Focus on whether the insuring agreement was a personal accident policy, which various
                       authorities see as not a contract of indemnity
               3.      Court finds that contracts of indemnity are determined by the exact nature of the contract
                       and not by its categorization
               4.      Sources of categories
                       a.       Hazard insured against, e.g., fire insurance
                       b.       Antithesis of the hazard insured against, e.g., credit insurance
                       c.       Name of the item, e.g., aircraft insurance
                       d.       Generic name, e.g., marine insurance

               5.      Confusion from use of the term “insured” to refer to an item, whereas in reality, is the
                       person owning or being responsible for something
               6.      Distinctive nature of life insurance contracts
                       a.       Annuity payments not seen to resemble an indemnity contract
                       b.       Not able to translate a loss of life into a pecuniary loss
                       c.       Policy upon a contingency, not a policy of indemnity
                       d.       Not based on the idea of compensation
               7.      Principle of indemnity
                       a.       Relief of the financial impact of a contingent event by shifting risk to the insurer
                                in exchange for premium
                       b.       Thus principle of indemnity is governing principle
                       c.       For this not to apply, specific wording must exist in the contract
                       d.       Insured must prove the following to recover
                                1)       Happening of an event that results in the insurer's liability
                                2)       Loss to the insured from the event
                       e.       Payment equals the lower of the contract maximum and the amount of the loss
               8.      Valued policy
                       a.       Insurer and insured agree to a specific value
                       b.       Insured relieved of having to prove the amount of the loss but must still prove the
                                fact of the loss
                       c.       Remains a contract of indemnity
                       d.       Contrasts with a policy that pays a fixed sum on the happening of an event
                                1)       Payment regardless of whether the insured suffers a loss, e.g., accidental
                                         death policy
                                2)       Reflects the difficulty of proving pecuniary loss
                       e.       Personal accident policy can be either one of indemnity (if proof of loss required)
                                or a valued policy (if no proof required)
               9.      Conclusion that even though the section of the policy dealt with personal accident
                       coverage, since it involved the payment of actual expenses incurred, it constituted a policy
                       of indemnity to which the principle of subrogation applies
      E.       Classification in the Insurance Act for the Purpose of Regulating the Contract Between Insured
               and Insurer
               1.      Overview

                       a.       Insurer resists payment of loss because proof of loss not furnished within 60 days
                       b.       Court dismisses the insurer's arguments and orders payment
                                1)       Though titled an inland marine policy, the policy's primary risk was
                                         against fire and lightning
                                2)       Statutory provision of requiring proof as soon as practicable rather than
                                         a 60-day period applies
                                3)       Plaintiff found to meet the statutory provision
                                4)       In addition, company and insured agreed to a scheme of adjustment,
                                         which could not be satisfied within 60 days
                       c.       Two questions dealt with in case law
                                1)       What fire losses does the fire section of the Insurance Act cover?
                                         a)        According to the statutory definition, fire insurance does not
                                                   include insurance incidental to other classes
                                         b)        1959 ON revision of the fire section specifically lists cases where
                                                   section does not apply; other cases are thus covered
                                2)       Is the fire section applicable to losses from other perils?
                                         a)        Broad approach proposed instead of narrow classifications found
                                                   in the Insurance Act but not implemented in the 1955 revision of
                                                   the Uniform Fire Part
                                         b)        Various cases produce different interpretations
                                                   i)       Fire section does not apply at all to other perils
                                                   ii)      Fire section applies if fire is the primary risk
                                         c)        One way of achieving an integrated approach (i.e., having the fire
                                                   section apply to all perils) is to specify such in the policy
                                                   provisions but this may not be possible since in some aspects may
                                                   violate statutory provisions benefiting the insured
       F.      Group and Individual Insurance
               1.      Group insurance does not identify the individuals covered
               2.      Master contract is between the insurer and the sponsor
               3.      Insureds have only the rights given to them by the sponsor
               4.      Types of sponsors
                       a.       Employers
                       b.       Professional associations
                       c.       Trade unions
               5.      Differ from subscription policies where more than one insurer is needed to cover a large
                       commercial risk
       G.      Classes of Insurance for the Purpose of Licensing Insurers
               1.      A&S
               2.      Aircraft
               3.      Automobile

11.    a.      Statutory condition 15 of the Insurance Act takes precedence over the contract provision. That
               condition sets no time limit on the submission of proof of loss but only requires that it “be

               have encouraged them to engage in such concerted practices, p. 71"
93,Actex CAS 6 Canada Fall 2019 sample .pdf,18,"13.    “The explanation for this special status lies in the view that uncontrolled price competition in the short
       term is not in the public's long term interest. Too vigorous price competition in the short term results in
       insurers collecting less in premiums than is necessary to meet their future liabilities. The resulting
       bankruptcy of an insurer could have a catastrophic effect on its customers. Since insurance companies are
       like banks in that they administer large sums of what is, in effect, their customers' money, special rules are
       necessary to guarantee their continued solvency,” p. 69"

               of a loss against which the policy has been made, shall be fully indemnified, but shall never be

I.     SUBROGATION AND COLLATERAL BENEFITS
       A.       Broader View of Subrogation
                1.      Number of alternatives for compensating a victim
                        a.       Universal public hospital and medical insurance
                        b.       Private accident insurance
                        c.       Liability of the negligent party or his insurer
                2.      System produces gaps and overlaps
                3.      Subrogation reflects the belief that a victim should not be overcompensated
       B.       Alternative Approaches to Problem of Duplicate Recoveries
                1.      Election – victim can choose his compensation source
                2.      Cumulation – victim can collect from more than one source
                3.      Reimbursement - tortfeasor must pay all damages and any excess is returned to the
                        collateral source
                4.      Relieving the tortfeasor – tortfeasor's liability is reduced by the amount of the collateral
                        benefit
       C.       Comments on the Approaches
                1.      All but cumulation prevents double recovery
                2.      Relieving the tortfeasor and possibly election reduces the tortfeasor's liability
                3.      Reimbursement and relieving the tortfeasor represent policy choices as to which
                        compensation source should be primary
                4.      Subrogation
                        a.       Current emphasis is on compensation rather than admonishment; because of
                                 insurance, subrogation does not put the ultimate burden on the wrongdoer
                        b.       Very expensive mechanism as applied on an individual case basis
                        c.       For NF auto benefits, recent shift (by courts or legislation) not to allow
                                 subrogation but to reduce the tort claim by the amount of accident benefits

                                 2)      Public liability and property damage (PL/PD)
               3.      Insured contends that renewal notice had words “not applic” typed in for UMC which he
                       believed meant it did not apply to him since he had requested the maximum available
                       coverage
       B.      The Courts Below
               1.      Trial judge finds that insured was entitled to rely on the advice of the company's agent;
                       otherwise, he should have been referred to a private agent
               2.      Company breached its duty to the insured when it failed to advise him of the full range of
                       coverage
               3.      Appeal Court, however, reverses the trial judge in a split decision as one judge finds no
                       duty and another finds duty but no breach
               4.      Appeal made to the Supreme Court
       C.      The Issues and Analysis
               1.      Did the Appeal Court err in departing from the trial judge's finding of fact? – yes, as
                       findings that insured relied on the company's employees and would have purchased UMC
                       if it had been offered were reasonable
               2.      Did the insurer have a duty provide advice on underinsured motorist coverage?
                       a.        Important issue as if duty exists, will affect company training of employees
                       b.        Tort
                                 1)      Is there a duty of care?
                                         a)       In certain cases, provider of information does has a duty of care
                                                  to the person receiving the information
                                         b)       Example: a banker providing references of solvency
                                         c)       Requirements for duty of care to exist
                                                  i)       Was there reliance? – yes, as insurance compulsory and
                                                           government was the only insurer
                                                  ii)      Was the reliance reasonable? – yes
                                                  iii)     Was the reliance expected? – yes, company was aware
                                                           of customers' reliance
                                 2)      What is the scope of duty?
                                         a)       Scope seen between that of a private agent and that of an ordinary
                                                  seller
                                         b)       Duty of private agents and brokers
                                                  i)       To provide information on available coverages
                                                  ii)      Also to provide individualized advice regarding the
                                                           coverages required to meet customer needs
                                                  iii)     Need to review coverage and point out gaps
                                                  iv)      Seen as more than mere salespeople
                                         c)       Duty of public insurers
                                                  i)       Duty to provide information on the available range of
                                                           coverages
                                                  ii)      Employees, however, not seen as risk specialists and thus
                                                           do not need to provide individualized advice
                                                  iii)     Contention that government insurer should be granted
                                                           immunity in cases where fail to provide information seen

122,Actex CAS 6 Canada Fall 2019 sample .pdf,23,"                       d.       Contract – since duty grounded in tort, this argument of contractual duty was not
                                pursued
                3.     If duty existed, did the insurer fulfill it? – court concludes no
                       a.       Contrasts MPIC failure to institute a public education campaign whereas the
                                Insurance Corporation of British Columbia had
                       b.       Failure to inform the insured of UMC availability seen as below the standard of
                                care
                       c.       Concludes that insured was never in the position to make an informed choice
                4.     If the insurer did not fulfill its duty, is it liable for the appellants' loss?
                       a.       Yes, as failure to purchase UMC was the result of several acts and omissions of
                                the insurer
                       b.       Case indicates that public auto insurers are obligated to act reasonably and in their

III.   THE CLAIMS PROCESS
       A.       Broadhurst & Ball v. American Home Assurance Co"
123,Actex CAS 6 Canada Fall 2019 sample .pdf,23,"                1.     Factual background
                       a.       Defendants sued for conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence
                       b.       Policies of both the primary and excess professional liability insurers agree to
                                provide defence against covered suits and to pay associated expenses
                       c.       Excess insurer contended that the insureds were aware of the claims when they
                                obtained insurance and thus no coverage was provided
                       d.       Findings of the trial judge
                                1)        Claims are covered by the excess policy, subject only to exclusionary
                                          provisions
                                2)        Excess insurer has a duty to defend the insured against the claims
                                3)        Excess insurer need not share the costs and expenses of defending the
                                          action
                       e.       Excess insurer appeals the first two findings
                2.     Issues
                       a.       Whether trial judge should have waited until after the trial to decide that coverage
                                of the claims existed
                       b.       Whether excess insurer must defend when the primary insurer also has this
                                obligation
                       c.       If concurrent obligation to defend exists, how costs of the action should be
                                allocated
                3.     Coverage issue
                       a.       Initial allegation that claims reflected fraudulent conduct and not negligence (and
                                thus not covered by the policy) was withdrawn
                       b.       Allegation that insureds knew or should have known when they applied for
                                coverage (and thus claims were not covered by the policy) was dismissed for lack
                                of evidence
                       c.       Resolution of the coverage issue prior to the outcome of the trial not deemed
                                improper as remote possibility anything in the trial will affect coverage

               4.      Allocation of defence costs issue
                       a.      Since insurers provide coverage under separate contracts, no legal basis for
                               contribution
                       b.      American decisions show contradictory positions that primary insurer has no right
                               of action against the excess insurer and primary insurer subrogated to the rights
                               of the insured against the excess insurer when defending claims that have
                               exhausted its limits
                       c.      Appleman's view
                               1)        Primary insurer's duty to defend is absolute and indivisible and only the
                                         insured can enforce
                               2)        Only the insured can call on the excess insurer for defence; third parties
                                         have no standing
                       d.      But in the current case, a potential judgment puts the excess carrier at risk
                               1)        Excess carrier should thus not excuse itself based on the primary carrier's
                                         obligation to provide a defence
                               2)        Not having it share costs provides it with a windfall
                               3)        Lack of involvement, moreover, constitutes an obstacle to settlement
                               4)        Equitable distribution of costs justified not by a contractual basis but by
                                         the principles of equity and good conscience
                               5)        But allocation based not on the pro rata distribution of coverage but rather
                                         equally between the parties
       B.      Dillon v. Guardian Insurance Co"
125,Actex CAS 6 Canada Fall 2019 sample .pdf,24,"               1.      Insurer fails to agree to a settlement for less than the policy limits and trial produces a
                       judgment in excess of the policy limits, causing the insured to sue the insurer for the excess
                       amount
               2.      No Canadian standard to be applied to the insurer's conduct but three standards found in
                       U.S. law
                       a.      Absolute liability
                       b.      Liability for failing to act reasonably
                       c.      Liability for bad faith – seen as merging with the second standard
               3.      Arguments in favor of absolute liability
                       a.      Avoids the problem of determining whether settlement offer was reasonable
                       b.      Avoids possibility insurer will gamble with the insured's money if offer near the
                               policy limits
                       c.      As interests of the insurer and insured conflict, insurer should have both the
                               benefits and detriments of its decision
               4.      Application to the current case
                       a.      No need to select a standard as insurer liable under each of them
                       b.      Court finds in favor of the insured and absolves the insured's lawyer of any
                               liability as company employee should know it is liable for an excess award
               5.      BC cases
                       a.      Relationship between the insurer and insured is not a fiduciary one as have
                               different interests
                       b.      Rejection of the standard of absolute liability
